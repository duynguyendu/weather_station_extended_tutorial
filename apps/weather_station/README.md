A simple KOS Elixir app

Besides the usual mix and Elixir stuff, it also contains appropriate
CMakeLists.txt that are used when building in a KOS
build environment. mix.exs also has extra code used when building for KOS.

This app is intended to be built by the KOS build system and to run on a KOS
device. It may or may not work if built and run on the host.
